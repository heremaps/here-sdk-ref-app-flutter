Place the here_sdk plugin folder here!

How to get the plugin folder:

1. Download the HERE SDK package for the _Navigate Edition_ from the [HERE platform](https://platform.here.com/sdk) portal.
2. Inside, you'll find zipped documentation assets and a zipped file named "heresdk-navigate-flutter-{version}.tar.gz".
3. Unzip this *.tar.gz file as it's containing the HERE SDK plugin.
4. Rename the unzipped folder to "here_sdk" and move the entire folder including its content to here.
